					<p>Today I really wanted to try and find some amazing <br>
					lighting to film my car in. I decided to go to the mall <br>
					around 12am so that there wouldnt be any distractions in <br>
					my shots. There where these parking lights I parked my car <br>
					under making my car look great.</p>
